SI System Issue #2
==================

Can the "SI system of measurement" be improved from its current definition?

How can those improvements be accomplished?

I have several issues with the SI system as currently defined.

Problem
=======

What is the proper way to indicate numbers and prefixes for base units of area and volume?

1 square millimeter (1 mm<sup>2</sup>) is not the same as 1 milli square meter.

1 cubic millimeter (1 mm<sup>3</sup>) is not the same as 1 milli cubic meter.

How do you "say" square meter and cubic meter with numbers and prefixes?

I've not heard people talk about the proper way to say square meter and cubic meter with numbers and prefixes.

Is it "50 kilo square meter"?

Is it "50 milli cubic meter"?

The concepts are "area" and "volume" which are extensions of linear length into 2 and 3 dimensions.

The beauty and simplcity of the SI system for other units doesn't seem to extend to area and volume.

There should be some easy way to use a number and a prefix along with a unit name to denote "area" and "volume".

THe SI system doesn't seem to have a name for the base unit of area, but more of a description (square meter).  This forces unwieldy usage of "50 000 square meters" instead of "50 kilo square meters".

The SI system has a name for a sub-unit of volume but not the base unit.  The current definition seems more of a description (cubic meter) than a name.  This forces unwidy usage such as "50 000 cubic meters" instead of "50 kilo cubic meters".  Additinally, people commonly talk about and think of the sub-unit liter as if it were the base unit which is not correct.  This is probably because it has a name that can be properly used with numbers and prefixes (50 kL).

THe SI system has proper names for units for everything except for kilogram, square meter, and cubic meter.

Why is that?

How can we fix it to make it easier to says, use, and think about area and volume?

Solution
========

I think it would be better to give the square meter and the cubic meter
a name.  "square meter" and "cubic meter" is competely accurate but more difficult to say than a simple name.
The SI system is at its best when each base unit has a name.

Example usage tables
====================

The following tables illustrate the use of the new units and show that the lines with blank names and notation are not easily said or notated, or thought about with the current rules and notation but easily extendable to "proper" usage of a number, prefix, and base name with the new unit names.

Area
====

Unfortunately, while the obvious choice for area is the "are", it and the "hectare" are previously used and currently used, respectively.
However they are wierdly sized units and "are" would not be suitable for a base unit unless we redefine the "are" and the "hectare".

1 are = 100 m<sup>2</sup> but is no longer in (common) use.

1 hectare = 100 are = 10 000 m<sup>2</sup>

If we could redefine the name "are = 1 square meter" and redefine the "hectare" (which I doubt is easily doable) then the "are" could be used for the base unit of area.

Greek word for square: tetra

Latin word for square: quad

Suggestion: At the moment I'm going to suggest "1 quad = 1 square meter".

Volume
======

Latin word for volume: liber (to close to liter, would be confused and indistinct over bad communication lines)

Wikipedia shows that a common name for 1 cubic meter is "stere" although for some reason the SI doesn't give that name.

Suggestion: At the moment I'm going to suggest "1 vol = 1 cubic meter" because "vol" is one syllable and easier to say than "stere".

Advantages
==========

1. Gives names to the "square meter" and "cubic meter" units. Names are powerful and simplify the notation, thinking about, and being able to say it.
2. Follows the normal SI rules for numbers, prefixes, and unit names and notation.
3. Single syllable.
4. Gives names and notation to sections of the table that currently don't have a name when using the normal SI notation with "X square Ym", X is a number between 1 - 999 and Y is some prefix.


Disadvantages
=============

1. Might take (a long) time to get the world to use it (like other SI name changes, unit additions, etc for example "Cycles per second -> Hertz" and "Centigrade -> Celsius").
2. Other disavantages?

I don't care about the particular names I've currently selected, they could be anything but would be handy to have them be one syllable.
