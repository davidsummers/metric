                        SI System Issue #2

Can the "SI system of measurement" be improved from its current definition?

How can those improvements be accomplished?

I have several issues with the SI system as currently defined.

Even though the SI system prefixes are fairly simple as they are currently defined (2022), I think the SI system prefix names and rules can be made even more simple and more regular.

Whenever I look at the list of prefixes, several things immediately stand out glaringly to me and are hard for me to ignore:

1. The difference in capitalization of the magnifying prefixes ( currently "kilo" is not capitalized but the rest are ).
2. The endings are not consistent.  Some end in '-a' and some in '-o' and there doesn't seem to be a rule.
3. There is no need for the 'deka', 'hecto', 'deci', and 'centi' prefixes; they only clutter up the number of prefixes close to 1. Let's get rid of prefixes we don't absolutely need.  We can simplify the system by deprecating them.  Instead of saying something is 1 centimeter we can say something is '10 millometers' (combing rules and deprecation).
It simplifies the system to only have prefixes in multiples of 10<sup>3</sup> units and makes it match Engineering notation.  The main reason is the simplication of the system which makes things easier to teach, learn, and use.  At the very least, let's change the names to abide by more regular rules.

Proposal:

Regularize the prefix names from previous irregular rules and deprecate as follows:

Rules

1. Magnifying prefixes start with upper case letters, minifying prefixes start with lower case letters.
2. Magnifying prefixes end in "-a", Minifying prefixes end in "-o".
3. Deprecate 'hecto', 'deka', 'deci', and 'centi', and regularize their endings.

I expect this proprosal to be controversial. All I can say is I think it would help the current SI system become more simplified and regular which is always a good thing in my opinion.

The SI system is constanly evolving and changing to be better, why not make it better by doing this?

Thanks for your consideration.

Examples:

*** Note: The following prefixes cover the majority of all usage, although two new Magnifying and minifying prefixes are currently proposed by the CGPM committee. Currently there are 16 total prefixes (with the deprecation mentioned).  If the CGPM committee proposal is carried out there will be 20 prefixes (with deprecation mentioned).

Magnifying Prefixes

Minifying Prefixes

| Value            | SI Symbol | Prefix Symbol | Notes                 |
| :---             | :---      | :---          | :---                  |
| 10<sup>-3</sup>  | millo     | m             | Currently "milli"     |

| 10<sup>-24</sup> | yocto     | y             | So small it is rarely used. |

Deprecate and change:

1. hecto -> Hecta
2. deka  -> Deka
2. deci  -> deco
4. centi -> cento
