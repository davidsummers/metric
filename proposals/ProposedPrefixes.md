                        Proposed SI Prefix Changes

Regularize the prefix names from previous irregular rules.

Even though the current SI system is fairly simple, I think it can be made even more simple and regularized.

Whenever I look at the list of prefixes, several things immediately stand out glaringly to me and are hard for me to ignore:

1. The difference in capitalization of the magnifying prefixes ( currently "kilo" is not capitalized but the rest are ).
2. The endings are not consistent.  Some end in '-a' and some in '-o' and there doesn't seem to be a rule.
3. There is no need for the 'deka', 'hecto', 'deci', and 'centi' prefixes.  We can simplify the system by deprecating them.  Instead of saying something is 1 centimeter we can say something is '10 millometers' (combing rules and deprecation).
It simplifies the system to only have prefixes in multiples of 10<sup>3</sup> units and makes it match Engineering notation.  The main reason is the simplication of the system which makes things easier to teach, learn, and use.

Proposal:

Deprecate 4 prefixes.  If not deprecate then at least change 4 existing prefixes to be in more regular form.

Rules

1. Magnifying prefixes start with upper case letters, minifying prefixes start with lower case letters.
2. Magnifying prefixes end in "-a", Minifying prefixes end in "-o".
3. Deprecate 'hecto', 'deka', 'deci', and 'centi', and regularize their endings.
