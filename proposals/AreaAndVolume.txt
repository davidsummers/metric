New names for units of area and volume.

I think we will probably need a different name than "are" for area.
I don't think "are" can be repurposed because "hect(o)are" is still in use.
But if it could:

A new unit name for area could be named "are".

1 are  = 1  m^2
1 mare = 1 mm^2

A new unit name for volume other than "1 cubic meter" could be named "Vol".

1  Vol = 1000 liters = 1 cubic meter      = 1  m^3
1 mVol =    1 liter  = 1/1000 cubic meter = 1 mm^3
