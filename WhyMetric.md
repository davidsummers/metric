Why Metric?
===========

1. The SI Metric system is the accepted world-wide standard, including in the US.
2. A country only needs one standard measurement system.  It doesn't need two.  Any more introduces errors and confusion.
3. THe SI Metric system is the only standard measurement system that includes electricity and magnetism.  The US customary measurement system has no units for electricty and magnetism.
4. The SI Metric system simplifies all measurement units by using one name for each unit of measurement instead of multitudes of different names.  There are at least 199 different names for energy in the US customary system.  In the SI metric system there is only one.  The same applies to many other units of measurement.
5. The SI metric system is the *preferred* measurement system in the US by law.
